I drive out of the way for this place. They have the best kimchi! I love the egg and rice dish they have and the kimchi fried rice is bomb. Made fresh so prepare to wait.
Went here for the first time with my cousin with no expectstions. Walked in explained we were new the toe men working were super friendly explained how things are done and throughout our meal did exceptional with making sure are needs were met. The pot stickers leave ya wanting more! ðŸ¤¤ will definitely be back.
Fascinating specimens!! Anyone who is saying that there was nothing interesting clearly isn't really into paleontology. There were quite a few new/"not yet named" species with full casts! Amazing to see how huge ancient creatures were, and to find out how many of these fossils were found!! I completely recommend visiting.
Beautiful area for young children and adults to enjoy the ducks! Just something special and innocent about throwing bread for ducks to fight over.... Way cool to see all the turtles too!
 had to ship a ton of stuff to another state because I was moving. Each member of the staff helped me pack and send everything ensuring it was correctly and economically done. So impressed! Thanks for making my move easier and less stressful
