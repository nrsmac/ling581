I have been trying to get a paper statement for month. I can't tell what they are doing with my payments. Also to find out if there have been any hidden charges. It is a simple request. I don't want just am email telling me what I owe. From the responses I have read it appears that they take care of their locals not outsiders. Every loan I have ever had sent out a statement. Beware of the banking institute
Food is good some of the time but my god I was waiting in line for forever and the line closer to the building for drive thru was going fast but the outer lane was not. Such a shame to keep paying customer waiting behind others who weren’t there for very long. Unprofessional and needs drastic changes
  How long are you guys gonna leave that bag of trash there? Bag of trash had been sitting in the grass next to your parking lot for a month now. And you wonder why you have so many complaints. Trash everywhere, fly problem, and needles in the bathrooms is why I don't go here anymore. Clearly you need new management because yours isn't doing their job.
  tried to buy some things off the app came to about $30.00 had it shipped to the store and SHIPPING ALONE WAS $230.00 yeah over 800%. So I called the store and got told that it’s like Amazon and you have to pay it or don’t get it. So the total is about $30.00 and shipping is $230.00 do you not see a problem with that. He said and I quote it ain’t my problem.
Pickup is like playing Russia Roulette. Spent 15 minutes calling the main store number as well as the numbers posted in the stalls and no one picks up  and if they do hang up  someone parks next to me and they're out with their order within 3 minutes I am speechless
